An Insider's Gay Guide to Ho Chi Minh City: Tips &amp; Scam Alerts

Hey everyone. After living in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) for the past three months, I've learned a lot about the local scene. If you're here looking to have some fun, I have some essential advice.

Please read this carefully—it will help ensure you have the best (and safest) experience and avoid common pitfalls.

1. Be Wary of Inflated Online Prices
Prices you see on many online platforms or hookup apps are often far higher than the local standard.

For reference, the standard local rate for "quick fun" is typically in the 1–2 million VND (approx. $38 - $76) range. If you're being quoted significantly more than this, ask yourself why you're not in Thailand, which offers far more options and a much more developed scene for that kind of money.

2. The Local Spa Option (Recommended)
If you're looking for a straightforward and transparent experience, I strongly recommend using the local men's spas.

Here's the simple process:

Search on Google Maps for "spa for men."

Check their profile for a phone number.

Contact them directly via WhatsApp or Zalo (a Vietnamese app, but many use WhatsApp for foreigners) to book.

The best part is that the prices are public and transparent. You'll pay the same fixed rate as a local, so you don't need to worry about being ripped off or overcharged.

3. 🚨 MAJOR SCAM ALERT: The Deposit
This is the most important warning in this guide. Please read it carefully.

If you find someone on a gay chat app (Grindr, Blued, etc.) and they demand a deposit ("đặt cọc") to "book" them, HE IS A SCAMMER.

It doesn't matter what his excuse is:

"It's late at night, so I need a deposit to come over."

"It's just my policy; I always require a deposit."

"All my regular customers pay a deposit, you're no different."

These are all lies. The deposit amount might seem small, but they are only trying to get that one payment before they block you and disappear.

To be crystal clear: ANYONE (especially a 'callboy') who asks for an upfront deposit for a hookup is a scammer. Period. No exceptions.

4. General Tourist Price Gouging
This is a general travel tip for Vietnam that also applies here: Never buy anything from a shop or street vendor that doesn't have a clearly marked price.

It's very common for vendors to see a foreigner and charge two, three, or even more times the actual price. Always ask for the price first or shop where prices are listed.

Final Thoughts
That's all the advice I have. Ultimately, you just need to be smart and know how to spot the people who are trying to scam you. People like this exist in every country, don't they?

So, for the sake of your own experience (and your wallet), please think carefully and be safe.
